Joseph is a Professor in the [EECS department](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, a co-director and founding member of the UC Berkeley [Sky Computing Lab](http://sky.cs.berkeley.edu), [RISE Lab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu), and a member of the Berkeley AI Research ([BAIR](bair.berkeley.edu) Group). His [research interests](research) span artificial intelligence and data systems and he has a wide range of projects including:

* large language models (LLMs) that interact with external systems (e.g. tool use, RAG, LLM agents, long context windows)
* system support for large language model deployment (e.g. inference, serving, RAG, batch)
* large model finetuning
* machine learning on edge devices
* new approaches to cloud computing
* accelerated deep learning for high-resolution computer vision
* software platforms for autonomous vehicles

In 2020, Joseph launched a new stealth company based on his research to radically simplify the process of deploying advanced analytics and machine learning in modern data driven enterprises. Prior to joining Berkeley, Joseph co-founded <a href="http://Turi.com">Turi Inc.</a> (formerly GraphLab), which was based on his thesis work on the <a href="https://github.com/dato-code/PowerGraph">GraphLab and PowerGraph Systems</a>.  Turi was eventually <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup/">acquired</a> by Apple.


## News 

* AI generated videos are becoming more realistic by the day! üé• Compare videos side-by-side from cutting-edge models and check out our new leaderboard at [VideoArena](https://www.videoarena.tv). 

* We release [Gorilla Large Language Model](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/) ü¶ç LLMs need to interact with the world through APIs, and we teach LLMs to write APIs calls accurately without hallucination. 

* POET is featured by [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/neural-network-training)! The first demonstration on how to train SOTA ML models on smartphones and resource constrained edge devices.
